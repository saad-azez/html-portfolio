<h1>Top anime's/manga according to saadi</h1>
<h2>3 anime's/manga list</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Berserk</h3>
<p>An absolutely amazing art displayed by <i>Kentaro Miura</i>. He's passed away but his work for berserk is being carried by his best friend <i>Koji Mouri</i> .</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>I gotta say this one is perfect, down to the last moment. Like it has so much adventure everything related to it has mistery and its so in depth. I love how <i>Eichiro Oda</i> has carried the whole story in his mind for almost more then 25+ years.</p>

<h3>Monster</h3>
<p>Monster is the best psychological anime i've watched. Everything in that anime even it's intro is as good as its anime. If i had a chance to meet the writer <i> Naoki Urasawa </i> i would ask him what was his in his mind when he created that master piece.</p>
